			<h1> HEALTHY NITRITION</h1>
			<p>Why are healthy snacks important?
Athletes and active people need more calories and nutrients than people who do not exercise regularly. Nutrients include carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals. Healthy snacks can provide these extra calories and nutrients you need. Eating a healthy snack before exercise will give you energy. Eating a healthy snack right after exercise can keep you from overeating during mealtime.<br>

What snacks should I avoid?
Avoid snacks that are high in fat and sugar. Some examples are doughnuts, cookies, potato chips, candy bars, and sodas. These foods are low in healthy nutrients. They may not give you the energy you need to perform well during exercise and sports competitions.What kind of snacks should I eat?<br>
Eat snacks that are fast, easy, and healthy. You will have to plan these snacks ahead of time and have them available when you need them. This will make it easier for you to fit in healthy snacks during a busy schedule. Choose snacks from all the food groups to get a variety of nutrients throughout the day.Some snacks will need to be kept in a refrigerator or in a cooler with ice so they will not spoil. Make sure these foods are not at room temperature for more than 2 hours. After 2 hours, bacteria can grow in these foods, which can make you sick. Food that should be kept cold includes milk and dairy products, such as cottage cheese and yogurt. It also includes salads or sandwiches made with meat, fish, or poultry.</p>
